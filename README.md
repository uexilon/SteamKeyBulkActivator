# Steam Key Bulk Activator
A simple console application to activate steam keys in bulk. Written because I was too lazy to enter 50+ Keys from a Humble Bundle manually.
Fully automated only in windows (Opens tabs for each key on linux and macOS).
Login to steam in the webbrowser and keep the browser open. No need to enter your password in this app as it only opens new tabs and inserts the key into the official steam webpage.

Steam caps out at around 50 Keys. If you got more than 50 you'll need to wait for an hour or two (As I have learned myself).

Needs .Net5 to be installed.
